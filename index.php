          <p>
            My name is Isaac Jimenez. I am currently enjoying the programming
            side of web development. Growing up, the world wide web was always a
            magical place. It was a free resource for learning anything you ever
            wanted and seeing any place in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            My personal hobbies are learning about different disciplines. Web
            development has been the only realm where my interests in
            psychology, philosophy, economics and the arts are put into
            practice.
